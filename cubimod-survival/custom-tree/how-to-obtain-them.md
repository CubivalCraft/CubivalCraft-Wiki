# ‚ùî How to obtain them?

Currently, players can only obtain custom trees like Maple, Twilight, Wisteria, and Sakura by trading at the Sapling Exchange Terminal. These unique and enchanting trees bring a touch of beauty and diversity to your world.

However, these custom trees may eventually be found naturally in the Overworld once the borders are expanded.
