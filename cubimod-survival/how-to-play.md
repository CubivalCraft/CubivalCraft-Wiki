# How to play?

**If you choose not to install the server resource pack, you will still be able to play the game as usual because we do not modify any core aspects of Minecraft/Mojang. However, please note that without installing the server resource pack, you will not be able to see all the custom textures and additions specific to our server. These include custom ores, custom swords, furniture, cosmetics, and other custom items.**

**To play, simply join the server and start playing Minecraft as you normally would. The added custom content will be available for those who have installed the server resource pack.**
