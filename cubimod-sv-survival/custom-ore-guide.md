# Custom Ore Guide

#### **Guide For Custom Item:**

***

**Server Resource Pack Installation:**

While it's not mandatory to install the server resource pack, we highly recommend doing so to fully experience the custom textures and additions unique to our server. By installing the resource pack, you'll be able to see custom ores, custom swords, furniture, cosmetics, and other custom items in their intended visual form. However, the core aspects of Minecraft/Mojang remain unchanged, ensuring you can still play the game as usual even without the resource pack.

**Found Custom Ore?**

Congratulations on discovering the custom ores on our server! It's an exciting find. However, it's important to note that breaking these custom ores requires specific tools.

* Meteorite Ore: To break Meteorite Ore, you'll need a Netherite Pickaxe.
* Celestrium Ore: To break Celestrium Ore, you'll need a Meteorite Pickaxe.
* Infernium Ore: To break Infernium Ore, you'll need a Celestrium Pickaxe.
* Endium Ore: To break Endium Ore, you'll need a Infernium Pickaxe.

_**Fortune won't work on custom ore**_

Make sure to upgrade your pickaxe accordingly to match the requirements of each custom ore. This will allow you to successfully mine and collect these valuable resources.

Additionally, if you're looking to obtain raw steel, participating in the voting system is the way to go. By using the "/vote" command in the game, you can earn vote keys. These keys can be used to unlock rewards, including raw steel, from the vote party crate. Don't forget to vote regularly to increase your chances of obtaining raw steel and other valuable items.

The rarity of finding Endium ore and Meteorite ore is intentional and designed to make the game more challenging and rewarding. While Meteorite ore may have a higher spawning chance compared to Endium ore, it is still intentionally difficult to find.

**What are custom ore the best?:**

1. Meteorite
