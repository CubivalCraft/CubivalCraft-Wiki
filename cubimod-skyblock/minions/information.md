# Information

Minions in **CubivalCraft Skyblock** are automated helpers designed to gather resources like ores, crops, or mob drops without player input. They continue working even when you're offline, making them crucial for resource collection and island progression. Minions require fuel to maintain efficiency and must be linked to a chest for storing the collected items. You can upgrade minions to improve their speed, storage capacity, and working range. Managing their position and actions is done through the **Minion Panel**.
